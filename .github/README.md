# GitHub Actions Status

## Current Status: Simplified for Initial Deployment

The CI/CD pipelines have been temporarily simplified to allow successful deployment. 

### Active Workflow

- **`minimal-check.yml`** - Basic repository validation

### Why Simplified?

The project uses a complex monorepo structure with:
- Django backend with custom requirements structure
- Next.js 14 frontend with TypeScript
- Multiple interdependent modules

Full CI/CD will be implemented after initial deployment when the infrastructure is stable.

### Next Steps

1. Deploy the application successfully
2. Configure test environments
3. Re-enable comprehensive CI/CD pipelines
4. Add test coverage reporting

For now, the focus is on **getting to production** with a working application.
