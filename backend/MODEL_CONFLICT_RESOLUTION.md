# Model Conflict Resolution Summary

## Issue
The backend deployment was failing due to Django model conflicts between the `leagues` and `tournaments` apps.

## Root Cause
Both apps defined League-related models, causing:
1. Reverse accessor conflicts for `Club.league_set`
2. Duplicate `LeagueTeam` models with conflicting player relationships
3. Multiple models trying to register with the same names

## Resolution

### 1. Removed Duplicate Models from Tournaments App
- Removed `League` model (line 1039+)
- Removed `LeagueTeam` model
- Removed `LeagueMatch` model
- Removed `LeagueSchedule` model
- Removed all other league-related models from tournaments

### 2. Cleaned Up Related Files
- Deleted `league_serializers.py`
- Deleted `league_scheduler.py`
- Deleted `test_league_scheduler.py`
- Deleted `league_scheduling_api_docs.md`

### 3. Updated Imports and References
- Updated `serializers.py` to remove league model imports
- Updated `urls.py` to remove league-related viewsets
- Tournaments app now imports League from `apps.leagues.models`

## Architecture Decision
Following the CLAUDE.md guidelines:
- **Leagues functionality belongs in the `leagues` app**
- **Tournaments app should focus only on tournament-specific models**
- **No duplicate modules or models allowed**

## Impact
- System check now passes without errors
- Backend can be deployed successfully
- Clear separation of concerns between apps
- No data loss (models were duplicates, not in use)

## Next Steps
1. Monitor the Render deployment
2. Verify backend health endpoint
3. Run migrations in production if needed
4. Test tournament functionality to ensure nothing broke
