from apps.authentication.middleware import FinancialSessionMiddleware

# Permission checks for payment operations
from apps.authentication.permissions import PaymentPermissions
```

#### Critical Requirements:
- ✅ User sessions must be validated before financial operations
- ✅ Session timeout must trigger financial operation cancellation
- ✅ User roles must determine payment access levels
- ✅ 2FA integration for high-value transactions (>$1000)

#### Risk Factors:
- 🚨 **Session hijacking** could lead to unauthorized payments
- 🚨 **Authentication bypass** could compromise payment security
- 🚨 **User privilege escalation** could access wrong financial data

### 2. Reservations Module (`apps.reservations`)

## 🚨 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

### Cross-Module Security

1. **Data Validation**

   - Sanitization required for external data
   - Type safety enforcement for monetary values

2. **Access Control**
   - Role-based access control for financial operations
   - Club isolation for multi-tenant security
   - Admin override capabilities with audit logging

3. **Audit Trail**
   - All cross-module financial operations must be logged
   - Immutable audit records required
   - Real-time monitoring for suspicious patterns

### Integration Security

```python
# Example secure integration pattern
@financial_operation(require_user=True, max_amount=Decimal('10000.00'))
def process_reservation_payment(reservation_id, user):
    # Validate user can access reservation
    reservation = get_reservation_safe(reservation_id, user)
    if not reservation:
        raise PermissionDenied("Cannot access reservation")
    
    # Validate reservation is payable
    if reservation.status != 'pending_payment':
        raise ValidationError("Reservation not in payable state")
    
    # Process payment with full audit
    with financial_transaction_context(user, 'reservation_payment'):
        return execute_financial_transaction(
            amount=reservation.total_amount,
            transaction_type='payment',
            reference_id=str(reservation.id),
            user=user
        )
```
