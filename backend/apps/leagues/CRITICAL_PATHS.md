# League Module Critical Paths

This document identifies and documents all critical operational paths in the League module. These are the essential workflows that must function correctly for the system to operate reliably.

## Critical Path Definition

A **critical path** is defined as any operational sequence where:
1. Failure results in data corruption or system instability
2. User experience is severely impacted
3. Business operations cannot continue
4. Data integrity is compromised

## Path 1: League Creation and Setup

### Flow Description
Complete workflow from league creation to ready-for-registration state.

### Critical Steps
```
1. User Authentication Validation
   ↓
2. Club Association Verification
   ↓
3. League Model Creation with Validation
   ↓
4. Initial Season Setup
   ↓
5. Rule Configuration
   ↓
6. Schedule Template Creation
   ↓
7. Permission Assignment
   ↓
8. League Activation
```

### Entry Points
- **API**: `POST /api/leagues/`
- **Admin**: Django admin interface
- **Bulk**: Management command `create_demo_leagues`

### Critical Validations
```python
# In LeagueIntegrityValidator.validate_league_creation()
- name: Required, unique per organization
- min_teams/max_teams: Within system limits (4-32)
- organizer: Valid user with permissions
- club: Valid club association
- format: Supported league format
- financial_settings: Valid fee structure
```

### Failure Points and Mitigations
1. **Database Transaction Failure**
   - *Mitigation*: Atomic transaction wrapping
   - *Rollback*: Complete league creation rollback
   
2. **Permission Validation Failure**
   - *Mitigation*: Pre-validation before database operations
   - *Fallback*: Error message with required permissions
   
3. **Club Association Failure**
   - *Mitigation*: Club existence validation
   - *Fallback*: Clear error message about invalid club

### Success Criteria
- League created with valid ID
- Initial season created and linked
- User has organizer permissions
- League visible in user's league list

### Monitoring
```python
# Health check in LeagueModuleHealth
def _check_league_creation_health():
    - Recent league creation success rate > 95%
    - Average creation time < 2 seconds
    - No orphaned league records
```

2. **Team Registration Race Condition**
   - *Mitigation*: Database-level unique constraints
   - *Recovery*: Atomic registration with select_for_update
   
3. **Payment Processing Failure**

   - *Fallback*: Pending status with retry mechanism

### Success Criteria
- Season created with valid dates
- Teams registered within capacity limits

   - Restore from backup when available

2. **Application Crash**
   - Automatic restart with health checks
   - Validate system state on startup
   - Resume interrupted operations

This critical path documentation ensures that all essential league operations are properly understood, monitored, and protected against failure scenarios.
