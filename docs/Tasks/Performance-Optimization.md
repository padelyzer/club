## üîó Dependencies
### Blocked By (must be completed first)
- **Database Schema Stability** - Core schema must be finalized before indexing optimization
- **API Endpoints Completion** - All endpoints should exist before caching implementation

### Blocks (this task blocks these)
- **Load Testing** - Performance baseline needed for comprehensive load testing
- **Production Deployment** - Performance optimization required before go-live
- **Mobile Optimization** - Foundation performance needed for mobile-specific optimizations

## üìù Implementation Notes
### Technical Approach
**Database Optimization Strategy**:
- Use Django Debug Toolbar to identify N+1 queries
- Implement select_related() for foreign key relationships
- Use prefetch_related() for many-to-many relationships
- Add database indexes for frequently filtered/ordered fields
- Implement query result caching for expensive computations

**Caching Strategy**:
- Redis for API response caching (TTL based on data volatility)
- Browser caching for static assets with proper cache headers
- Application-level caching for computed metrics and aggregations
- Cache invalidation strategy using signals and events

**Frontend Optimization**:
- Code splitting at route level and component level
- Image optimization with next/image and WebP format
- Service worker for offline capabilities and intelligent caching
- Bundle analysis to identify and eliminate unused dependencies

### Potential Challenges
**Cache Invalidation**: Keeping cached data in sync with database changes
- Solution: Event-driven cache invalidation using Django signals
- Cache versioning for gradual cache updates

**Database Connection Limits**: High concurrent load may exhaust connections
- Solution: Connection pooling with pgbouncer
- Connection monitoring and alerting

**Frontend Bundle Size**: Feature growth may increase bundle size over time
- Solution: Regular bundle analysis and tree shaking
- Dynamic imports for non-critical features

- [ ] All API endpoints respond within 200ms for 95% of requests
- [ ] Frontend pages load within 3 seconds on 3G network

- [ ] Database query execution times optimized (no queries >100ms)
- [ ] Load testing passes with 100 concurrent users
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable under sustained load
- [ ] Performance monitoring dashboards show green across all metrics
