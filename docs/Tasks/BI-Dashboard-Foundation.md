- **Completion Date**: January 11, 2025
- **Module**: BI/Analytics

## 🎯 Description
Create a comprehensive business intelligence dashboard that aggregates data from all Padelyzer modules to provide insights for club managers. This dashboard will serve as the central hub for data-driven decisions across court utilization, revenue tracking, player engagement, and operational efficiency.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Real-time revenue tracking across all payment methods displays current and historical data
- [ ] Court utilization analytics with heat maps show peak usage times and patterns
- [ ] Player engagement metrics track retention rates, activity levels, and satisfaction scores
- [ ] Tournament participation statistics display enrollment, completion, and performance data
- [ ] Class attendance metrics show instructor effectiveness and student engagement
- [ ] Predictive analytics forecast booking patterns for next 30 days with confidence intervals
- [ ] Export functionality allows PDF and Excel export for all reports
- [ ] Mobile-responsive dashboard interface works seamlessly on tablets and phones

## 🔧 Technical Requirements
- [ ] Create BI data models for aggregating data from all modules
- [ ] Implement real-time data synchronization mechanisms using WebSockets or polling
- [ ] Build REST API endpoints for dashboard data with proper caching
- [ ] Create React dashboard components using Chart.js or D3.js for visualizations
- [ ] Add Redis caching layer for performance optimization
- [ ] Implement role-based access controls for different user types (admin, manager, staff)
- [ ] Set up automated data refresh jobs for heavy analytics computations
- [ ] Create data validation and error handling for edge cases

## 🧪 Tests Required
- [ ] `bi-dashboard.spec.ts` - Dashboard component rendering and user interactions
- [ ] `analytics-api.spec.ts` - API endpoint functionality and response validation
- [ ] `data-aggregation.spec.ts` - Data accuracy and aggregation logic testing
- [ ] `performance-bi.spec.ts` - Load time testing with large datasets
- [ ] `real-time-sync.spec.ts` - WebSocket connection and data updates
- [ ] `export-functionality.spec.ts` - PDF and Excel export validation
- [ ] `mobile-responsive.spec.ts` - Mobile layout and touch interactions

## 📁 Files to Create/Modify
### Backend Files
- `backend/apps/bi/models.py` - Data aggregation models
- `backend/apps/bi/views.py` - API views for dashboard data
- `backend/apps/bi/serializers.py` - Data serialization for frontend
- `backend/apps/bi/analytics.py` - Analytics computation logic
- `backend/apps/bi/tasks.py` - Celery tasks for data processing

### Frontend Files
- `frontend/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/analytics/page.tsx` - Main dashboard page
- `frontend/src/components/analytics/RevenueChart.tsx` - Revenue visualization
- `frontend/src/components/analytics/CourtHeatMap.tsx` - Court utilization heatmap
- `frontend/src/components/analytics/PlayerMetrics.tsx` - Player engagement metrics
- `frontend/src/components/analytics/PredictiveCharts.tsx` - Forecasting visualizations
- `frontend/src/hooks/useAnalytics.ts` - Analytics data fetching hook
- `frontend/src/lib/analytics/exportUtils.ts` - Export functionality utilities

### Configuration Files
- `backend/config/celery.py` - Background task configuration
- `backend/config/cache.py` - Redis caching configuration

## 🔗 Dependencies
### Blocked By (must be completed first)
- **Database Optimization** - Clean, indexed data required for aggregation
- **API Stabilization** - All module APIs must be stable for data integration
- **Authentication System** - Role-based access controls need stable auth

### Blocks (this task blocks these)
- **Advanced Analytics (Sprint 18)** - Requires basic BI foundation
- **Mobile Dashboard** - Desktop version must be complete first
- **Client Reporting** - Depends on core BI infrastructure

## 📈 Progress Tracking
- [ ] **Planning Phase** - Requirements analysis and technical design
- [ ] **Setup Phase** - BI module setup and database models
- [ ] **Backend Implementation** - API endpoints and data aggregation logic
- [ ] **Frontend Implementation** - React components and visualizations  
- [ ] **Real-time Integration** - WebSocket setup and live data updates
- [ ] **Testing Phase** - Unit, integration, and E2E tests
- [ ] **Performance Optimization** - Caching and query optimization
- [ ] **Mobile Responsive** - Mobile layout and touch optimization
- [ ] **Export Features** - PDF and Excel export implementation
- [ ] **Documentation Phase** - Update API docs and user guides

## 📝 Implementation Notes
### Technical Approach
**Architecture**: Microservice approach with dedicated BI service
- Use Django REST framework for API layer
- PostgreSQL for data aggregation with proper indexing
- Redis for caching frequently accessed metrics
- React Query for frontend data management
- Chart.js for visualizations (lightweight and performant)

**Data Pipeline**: 
- Real-time events from all modules → Message Queue → BI aggregator → Cache → API
- Daily batch jobs for heavy computations and historical analysis
- WebSocket connections for real-time dashboard updates

### Potential Challenges
**Performance**: Large datasets may slow queries
- Solution: Implement data pagination and incremental loading
- Use database views and materialized views for complex aggregations

**Data Consistency**: Real-time updates vs. accuracy tradeoffs
- Solution: Eventual consistency model with conflict resolution
- Cache invalidation strategy for stale data

**Mobile Performance**: Complex visualizations on mobile devices
- Solution: Simplified mobile views with progressive enhancement
- Touch-optimized interactions and gestures

## 🎯 Definition of Done
This task is complete when:
- [ ] Dashboard loads within 2 seconds with sample data
- [ ] All visualization components render correctly on desktop and mobile
- [ ] Real-time updates work without page refresh
- [ ] Export functionality generates accurate reports
- [ ] API endpoints respond within 500ms for cached data
- [ ] All tests pass with >90% coverage
- [ ] Security audit passes for role-based access
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met with 1000+ concurrent users

## 📊 Time Tracking
### Time Log
- [Date] - [Hours] - [Description of work done]

**Estimated Breakdown**:
- Planning & Design: 4 hours
- Backend Development: 18 hours
- Frontend Development: 14 hours
- Testing & Debugging: 4 hours

### Velocity Metrics
- **Estimated vs Actual**: 40 hours estimated
- **Complexity**: High (involves multiple modules and real-time features)

## 🔍 Testing Notes
### Test Coverage
- Unit tests: Data aggregation logic, API endpoints
- Integration tests: Cross-module data flow
- E2E tests: Complete dashboard user workflows
- Performance tests: Load testing with large datasets

### Critical Test Scenarios
